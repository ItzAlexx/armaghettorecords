    <h1>Itz Ya Boii Alex!</h1> 
   <h2>Straight Chillin In Space</h2>
   <p>Teen Beach Movie 2 is my favorite movie and Kirby is my favorite Pokemon</p></body></body>
   <p>I play Overwatch and cut hair for a living</p></body></body>
   <p>Oh yeah and SpyFroMan is my favorite Youtuber</p></body></body>
   <p>It Used to be Dr. Egroll, but I guess he didn't like the famous life or something because he kind of quit out of nowhere.</p></body></body>
   <p>Maybe he's just taking a break. I hope he comes back. He was pretty cool.</p></body></body>
   <p>I mean, I don't really like watching people play Smite, and his jokes were not that good, but uhh he let me cut his hair <em>Twice</em></body></body> so he's pretty cool I guess.</p></body></body>
